When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local? When you want to share your work with others. When you want to
collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? This offers more
granular control over when changes are pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instaed of another? Forks are clones of repositories that only exist on
github. Clones are duplicates of github repos that can exist locally. Branches
are unique commit paths that allow you to add new features to a program or do
more "risky" things.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last know state of the remote stored
locally?
This helps ensure things are in sync.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder? I'd send files via email or FTP. This would be harder because it would be more difficult to keep track of changes. One would have to sift through email histories to ensure everything was up-to-date. GitHub would be easier because it keeps all info in the same place and makes it easy to see changes and corresponding change histories.
