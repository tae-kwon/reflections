When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local? When you want to share your work with others. When you want to
collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This offers more granular control over when changes are pulled.
