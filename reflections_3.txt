When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local? When you want to share your work with others. When you want to
collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? This offers more
granular control over when changes are pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instaed of another?
Forks are clones of repositories that only exist on github. Clones are duplicates of github repos that can exist locally. Branches are unique commit paths that allow you to add new features to a program or do more "risky" things.
